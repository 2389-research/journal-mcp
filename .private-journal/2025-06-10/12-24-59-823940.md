## Project Notes

Successfully implemented configurable embedding models for the journal-mcp server! Key accomplishments: 1) Added JOURNAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL environment variable support, 2) Updated EmbeddingService to accept model configuration with fallback hierarchy (parameter > env var > default), 3) Updated JournalManager and SearchService constructors to pass model config, 4) Added comprehensive tests for model configuration, 5) Updated documentation with available models and their trade-offs. Users can now choose between speed (MiniLM), accuracy (MPNet), or specialized models (paraphrase detection).
