## Project Notes

Successfully created comprehensive HTTP integration tests for remote journal posting! Key accomplishments: 1) Built mock fetch implementation that captures actual HTTP calls, 2) Validates real HTTP request structure including URL, method, headers, and JSON payload, 3) Tests various error scenarios (403, 500, network errors) with graceful degradation, 4) Verifies embedding vectors are transmitted correctly in payloads, 5) Validates timestamp precision and JSON serialization. All 9 tests pass perfectly!
