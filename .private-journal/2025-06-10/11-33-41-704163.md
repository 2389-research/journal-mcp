## Project Notes

About to implement remote journal posting for the journal-mcp project. Plan looks solid - going with environment variables for config, adding optional remote posting to existing JournalManager without disrupting local writes. Key insight: keep local writes as primary, remote as best-effort secondary operation. This maintains reliability while adding the team sharing capability Harper wants.
