## Project Notes

Successfully extended the remote journal posting to include embedding vectors! Key accomplishments: 1) Updated RemoteJournalPayload interface to include optional embedding field, 2) Modified JournalManager.tryRemotePost to generate embeddings for all content before sending, 3) Added comprehensive test coverage for embedding transmission, 4) Updated documentation with embedding vector examples and explanations. The embeddings enable semantic search and AI analysis on the remote server while maintaining privacy through vector representations.
