## Project Notes

Successfully implemented remote journal posting for the journal-mcp project! Key accomplishments: 1) Created RemoteConfig interface and HTTP posting infrastructure, 2) Extended JournalManager with optional remote posting that never blocks local writes, 3) Added comprehensive test coverage including integration tests, 4) Updated documentation with environment variable configuration and payload examples. The implementation follows the local-first principle - remote posting is best-effort and failures don't impact local journaling.
