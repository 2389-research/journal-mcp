## Project Notes

Just finished updating all version numbers from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 across the codebase for the remote-only mode release. Updated package.json, src/server.ts (MCP server version), and package-lock.json. This represents a minor version bump since remote-only mode is a significant new feature but maintains backward compatibility.
